One problem I encountered was deciding which HTTP request to use to obtain the desired file.
I solved this problem by reading through the notes and deciding that a GET request would be
most suitable for fetching the file from the server.

The main problem I encountered was figuring out how to format the GET request. What helped me 
solve this problem was by using the browser to fetch the file first and then using the Chrome
Developer Tools to see what was received in the HTTP Header when the file was fetched.
This helped me get a general idea of what would be required in my GET request. Then I googled
how to lay out a GET request in code and tried to implement this in my own code using the
knowledge I had acquired thus far. This failed because I was not specifying my pathname correctly.
Through debugging and trial-and-error I eventually managed to figure out a solution and get
my code working
